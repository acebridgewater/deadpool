## Are there more tweaks for max FPS?
Yes—there are **more potential settings** than the 38 bullet‑point items I listed earlier. That number was just a **starter checklist**, not a hard limit. The real number varies based on your **hardware, drivers, Windows build, BIOS options, and Fortnite renderer**. Instead of stacking hundreds of tweaks, the best results usually come from:

- **Dialing in a small set of high‑impact settings** (rendering mode, frame cap, GPU control panel, RAM/XMP, power plan).
- **Measuring FPS and 1% lows** after each change.
- **Avoiding “all‑in‑one” tweak tools** that make large, irreversible registry changes.

If you want a **max‑FPS preset list** tailored to your system, share:
- CPU / GPU / RAM / storage
- Monitor refresh rate
- Fortnite render mode (Performance, DX11, DX12)
- Current average FPS and 1% lows

I can then recommend the **highest‑impact tweaks** for your exact build.
